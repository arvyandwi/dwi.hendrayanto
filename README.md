# 🕶️ Overview

Welcome to the official repo of **[dwi.hendrayanto.blog](https://dwihendrayantoblog.vercel.app/)** — a blog built by a QA Engineer, for QA Engineers.

## 🤔 What is this?

This is the source code for my personal blog — powered by **Next.js**, **Notion API**, and a whole lot of testing energy.  
It’s where I write about Katalon, automation frameworks, testing strategies, and the occasional meme that sneaks into my workflow.

> _Originally forked from [morethan-log](https://github.com/morethanmin/morethan-log), but heavily customized to fit my preferences — from layout to theming, and content structure to automation philosophy._
